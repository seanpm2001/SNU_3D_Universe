### Request: Add Barnard Objects and the Andromeda Galaxy

I am trying to clear up some pinned tabs, so I need to write these down as a request. The SNU Universe project will travel all of the known universe, and people will be able to visit every known part of space, including parts out of the Milky Way Galaxy. Barnard objects and the Andromeda Galaxy are the next places to add.

I won't be adding this in for a while.
